# Structured Notes: Understanding the Position of Lord Shiva

**Speaker:** His Holiness Jayadvaita Swami
**Venue:** ISKCON Chowpatty
**Duration:** ~68 minutes (lecture + Q&A)

---

## 1. Spiritual Geography — Lord Siva's Abode

- **Devidham** — The material world where we live
- **Maheshdham** — Lord Siva's abode, above the material world but not the spiritual world
- **Haridham** — The abode of Lord Visnu (Vaikuntha planets)
- **Goloka Vrndavana** — The supreme abode of Lord Krsna, beyond Vaikuntha

> Lord Siva's position is not that of an ordinary living being. He's in his own category — there is no second person like Lord Siva.

---

## 2. Daksa's Offense

- Maharaja Daksa considered Lord Siva merely his son-in-law (married to his daughter Sati)
- Daksa expected Lord Siva to rise and offer him respect in the sacrificial assembly
- Lord Siva was deep in meditation and had no need to rise — he is beyond material conventions
- Daksa blasphemed Lord Siva's transcendental ornaments (ashes, skull garland, garland of weeds)
- **Key lesson:** One who honors the Supreme Personality of Godhead but doesn't honor Lord Siva is a great offender

---

## 3. The Complete Whole (Purnam)

- Krsna means the complete whole — complete with all integrated and extended parts
- Cutting away the Lord's energies would mean He's no longer Supreme (sun without sunshine analogy)
- Even the tiny ant is part and parcel of Krsna and deserves honor
- The great controllers (Krsna, Lord Siva) act unconventionally because they're entitled to — we cannot imitate them, only respect them

---

## 4. The Milk-Curd Analogy (from Brahma-samhita)

- Lord Brahma says: "I worship Govinda, of whom Lord Siva is a special manifestation"
- **Milk = Lord Visnu/Krsna** (the original)
- **Curd = Lord Siva** (milk transformed by contact with a sour substance)
- Curd is milk, but not exactly milk — similarly, Lord Siva is practically Visnu, but in touch with material nature
- **The critical distinction:** The Personality of Godhead is never in touch with material nature; Lord Siva is married to material nature (Parvati/Durga, the goddess of material energy)
- Yet Lord Siva is always in *control* of material nature

---

## 5. Asutosa vs. Visnu's Discriminating Mercy

### Lord Siva — Asutosa (easily satisfied)
- Gives material benedictions liberally: wealth, mystic powers
- Does not consider whether the benediction is good for the devotee
- Ravana, Vrkasura and many others received tremendous powers from Lord Siva
- His devotees are generally wealthy/powerful
- He himself lives like a poor man (no house, under a tree, animal skin)

### Lord Visnu — Discriminating mercy
- Slower to give benedictions — considers whether it will be good for the devotee
- When *most* merciful, He takes *everything away*: "yasya aham anugrhnami harisye tad-dhanam sanaih"
- Material opulences are illusory (maya) — Visnu strips them to bring the devotee to surrender
- His devotees are generally materially poor but spiritually rich
- People are therefore not always eager to become devotees of Visnu — but the intelligent ones do

## 6. Lord Siva as the Embodiment of False Ego (Ahamkara)

### Material Elements Hierarchy (gross to subtle)
1. **Earth** — most tangible, solid, stable
2. **Water** — flows, more subtle
3. **Fire** — still more subtle, can be seen
4. **Air** — cannot be seen
5. **Ether/Space (Akash)** — the most subtle material element; pervades everything; carries electronic signals
6. **Mind** — flip-flops (sankalpa-vikalpa: accepts, rejects, accepts again)
7. **Intelligence** — analyzes, discriminates (more sophisticated than mind)
8. **False Ego (Ahamkara)** — the most subtle; the meeting point of matter and spirit

### False Ego Explained
- It is the point where spirit *identifies with* and *desires to enjoy* matter
- Spirit has no connection with matter (asango hy ayam purusah), but when it looks toward matter and identifies with it, entanglement begins
- False ego is "neither matter nor spirit, but the meeting point" (Prabhupada)
- Technically categorized as material energy, but at the borderline
- From false ego, *everything* unfolds (like a tree from a seed): intelligence → mind → ether → air → fire → water → earth

### Connection to Lord Siva
- Lord Siva embodies/represents the ahamkara principle
- He carries the energy/glance of the Personality of Godhead for the manifestation of the material world
- False ego manifests in three divisions corresponding to the three modes:
  - **Vaikarika** — ego in goodness
  - **Taijasa** — ego in passion
  - **Tamasa** — ego in ignorance
- Elaborately described in the Third Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam

## 7. Lord Visnu's Glance and Creation

- Lord Visnu never comes in touch with material nature — He simply glances
- By that glance, material nature is impregnated with all living beings
- "The material nature is the mother; I am the seed-giving father" (BG reference)
- Lord Siva is manifested to carry that glance/potency and come in touch with material nature
- From the combination of Lord Siva and Goddess Durga, all living beings are created

### Prabhupada's Fan Story (illustration)
- Delhi pandal program; large industrial fan drowning out the speaker
- Prabhupada simply *glanced* in the direction of the fan
- Jayadvaita Swami, sitting near the fan, understood and turned it off
- "The glance has its agents also" — parallel to how Visnu's glance works through Lord Siva

---

## 8. Nilakanth — Drinking the Ocean of Poison

- During the churning of the ocean (samudra-manthana), a powerful poison was produced
- Lord Siva drank the poison and kept it in his throat, turning it blue → "Nilakanth" (blue throat)
- Lord Visnu was present but chose not to act, to show the glories of Lord Siva
- **Why we cannot imitate the great controllers:** Lord Siva smokes ganja — but he also drinks an ocean of poison. We can't do that. Therefore follow, don't imitate.

---

## 9. Lord Siva as the Greatest Vaisnava

- "Vaishnavanam yatha shambhu" — Among all Vaishnavas, Lord Siva is the greatest
- He has his own sampradaya: **Rudra-sampradaya** (one of four bona fide disciplic successions):
  1. Sri (Lakshmi) sampradaya
  2. Brahma sampradaya
  3. Kumara sampradaya
  4. Rudra (Siva) sampradaya
- His ultimate kindness is spreading devotional service to Krsna

### Devotees and Demigod Worship
- Hare Krsna devotees also honor the demigods — but not for material benedictions
- The gopis worshipped Katyayani (Durga) praying for Krsna as their husband
- Rukmini prayed to Lord Siva and Durga that Krsna would kidnap her
- Dhruva Maharaja asked Kubera for the blessing to always serve Krsna
- The proper mood: honor Lord Siva and pray for engagement in devotional service

---

## 10. Key Philosophical Distinctions

### Mind vs. Intelligence in Spiritual Life
- Taking to Krsna consciousness by the *mind* → may also leave by the mind (flip-flopping)
- Taking to Krsna consciousness by *intelligence* → becomes fixed
- This is why there are "so many books — to engage the intelligence"

### Maya vs. Spiritual Vision
- Anything thought of as "something for me to enjoy" = maya
- Anything engaged in the service of Krsna = spiritually transformed
- **Ravana vs. Hanuman:** Both connected to Sita Devi
  - Ravana wanted to enjoy → totally destroyed
  - Hanuman wanted to reunite Sita with Lord Rama → received spiritual blessings
- Temple life: if the deity is the center and devotees are servants = liberation; if *I* am the center using the deity = maya

### Lord Visnu is Never Transformed
- It's not that Lord Visnu *becomes* Lord Siva (like milk becoming curd where the milk is gone)
- Lord Visnu is always the same — but He has His extension as Lord Siva for interaction with material energy
- Both are eternally in their respective positions

## 11. Q&A Highlights

| Question | Answer Summary |
|----------|----------------|
| How does Lord Siva compare to devotees like Narada Muni or Haridas Thakur? | "Greatest" on the absolute platform is different from material calculation. Lord Siva is not even in the jiva category — he's beyond all jivas. We can't calculate in material terms. |
| Does the Supreme Lord lose His position when Lord Siva manifests? | Never. Lord Visnu is eternally the Supreme Lord. Lord Siva is His extension, not a transformation. |
| When devotees receive material opulence (temples, book distribution), is that maya or mercy? | Depends on consciousness. If the deity is the center = liberation. If *I* am the center = maya. |
| Is it right to offer goat sacrifices to Goddess Kali? | It's prescribed for those in the mode of ignorance who want to eat meat — with strict restrictions. For those in the mode of goodness, it's ghastly. The intelligent person chants Hare Krsna instead. |
| What is Siva-tattva? | "Tattva" = principle, essential quality, ontological status. Siva-tattva is the special position/nature of Lord Siva — a vast topic only skimmed in this lecture. |
| Where is Lord Siva's abode? | Multiple locations: Mount Kailash (in the material world), Maheshdham (beyond the material world), and Sadasiva (an eternal form in the spiritual world as an expansion of Sankarsana). |
